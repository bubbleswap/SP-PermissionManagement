  - Change url attribute value to your SharePoint site
    - e.g., https://yoursite.com
- Open index.html and start managing permissions!

You can modify either a selected user's permissions or the users in a group.

The dual list boxes on either edit page allow you to add or remove permissions/users to the selected user/group.  Just remember to save after!
